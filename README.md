**Data Project: CO2 and GDP**

**General Analysis:**

GDP and CO2 emmission has a positive correlation during the past 30 years globally.

**visual.py** is the first version of python plotting program

**cleandata.py** is made for the second version of plotting program to purify data

**visual2.py** is the second version of plotting program that works more efficiently

**visual3.py** is the area graph code

**area.html** is the graph of stacked area of co2 emmission

**plot.html** is a global co2 emmissions graph

**plot2.html** is a global co2 vs million GDP graph

**plot3.html** is scatter of world co2 emmission vs gpd

**plot4.html** is the co2 emmission of several countries

**plot5.html** is the gdp of several countries

**CO2E.csv** is the original csv data of CO2 Emmission

**GDP.csv** is the original csv data of GDP

**co2r.csv** and **gdpr.csv** is the cleaned version of the data with NaN set to 0

**co2re.csv** and **gdpre.csv** is the clearend version of the data with NaN values
